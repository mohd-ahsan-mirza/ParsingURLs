# ParsingURLs

This is my first python program. I have been learning the language for a few weeks now. The script simply goes to the HTML page of the
input URL using BeautifulSoup.It then retrieves the href attribute value at a specific position from a list of "a" anchor tags.This process
is repeated a number of times and the final value parsed through regex matching of the "a" anchor tag is the returned value.
