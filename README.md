# ParsingURLs

This is my first python program. I have been learning the language for a few weeks now. The program will use urllib to go and read the HTML using the input HTML string, extract the href vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and return the last name found.
